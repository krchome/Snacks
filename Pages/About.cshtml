        In her profession Sweety was a developer by day and snack queen by night. Soon her innate skills
        with all things cooking snacks and desserts took over her reputation as an accomplished developer.
        What started as a way to satisfy her taste buds for snacks and desserts became all consuming.
        Snack-O-Mania is not only about cooking those yummy and delicious snacks and desserts for her close circle 
        of family and friends, but has also used her coding skills in developing a professional online ordering
        system. This online system is a website that takes orders from any customer who has access to a computer
        and internet access or mobile with internet.It then sends an acknowledgement in an email to the customer
        and delivers the freshly cooked materials within 24 hours.
